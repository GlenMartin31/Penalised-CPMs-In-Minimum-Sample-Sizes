# Developing Clinical Prediction Models: the importance of penalization methods and quantifying bootstrap variability even when adhering to minimum sample size recommendations
Repo for the paper entitled "Developing Clinical Prediction Models: the importance of penalization methods and quantifying bootstrap variability even when adhering to minimum sample size recommendations", which is in preparation.

This paper explores the characteristics of CPM performance metrics, upon validation, of models developed using a range of penalisation methods compared with unpenalised maximum likelihood estimation, in derivation data that satisfy formal sample size criteria (Riley et al.). Additionally, it explores the between-sample variability of performance metrics, upon validation, for models developed using each penalisation approach. 

Further updates will be made to this README when the paper is published.
