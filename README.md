# Developing Clinical Prediction Models: the importance of penalization methods and quantifying bootstrap variability even when adhering to minimum sample size recommendations
Repo for the paper entitled "Developing clinical prediction models when adhering to minimum sample size recommendations: The importance of quantifying bootstrap variability in tuning parameters and predictive performance", which is published in Statististical Methods in Medical Research (2021, DOI: 10.1177/09622802211046388). 

This paper explores the characteristics of CPM performance metrics, upon validation, of models developed using a range of penalisation methods compared with unpenalised maximum likelihood estimation, in derivation data that satisfy formal sample size criteria (Riley et al.). Additionally, it explores the between-sample variability of performance metrics, upon validation, for models developed using each penalisation approach.
