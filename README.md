# Developing Clinical Prediction Models Using Data that Adheres to Minimum Sample Size Criteria: the importance of penalization methods and quantifying bootstrap variability
Repo for the paper entitled "Developing Clinical Prediction Models Using Data that Adheres to Minimum Sample Size Criteria: the importance of penalization methods and quantifying bootstrap variability", which is in preparation.

This paper explores the characteristics of CPM performance metrics, upon validation, of models developed using a range of penalisation methods compared with unpenalised maximum likelihood estimation, in derivation data that satisfy formal sample size criteria (Riley et al.). Additionally, it explores the between-sample variability of performance metrics, upon validation, for models developed using each penalisation approach.
